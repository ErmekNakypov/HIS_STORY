# HIS_STORY

His Story is an interactive movie game, focusing on a series of seven fictional police interviews from 2023. One of the programs automatically open on the desktop is the "L.O.G.I.C. Database", which allows the player to search and sort video clips within the database, of which there are 43.The video clips are police interviews with Asanbek u Rysbek, a Kyrgyz man. The interviews are unable to be watched in their entirety, forcing the player to view short clips.In the interviews, Rysbek answers unknown questions to an off-screen detective, prompting the player to decipher the context of the answers.Rysbek's answers are transcribed, and the player find clips by searching in the database for words from the transcriptions, attempting to solve the case by piecing together information. As the player selects clips, they can enter user tags, which are then available as searchable terms.
